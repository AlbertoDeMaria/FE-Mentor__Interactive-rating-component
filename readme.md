## Front-End Mentor Challenge
### Newbie Level (Html + CSS + Responsive design)

Hello everyone, thank you for checking out my work. This is a challenge I wanted to take on to work on and improve my skills as a Frontend developer. I found the challenge on the famous Front-end Mentor website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and decided to give it a try.

In this project, in addition to enhancing my HTML and CSS skills, I needed to use JavaScript to store the user's choice in a variable so that it can be displayed on the thank-you card. To slightly increase the difficulty, I chose to use the SCSS preprocessor to practice optimized coding based on variables.

You can find the original design provided by Front-end Mentor and my result.
